**[TODO]**

<!--

  - basic use case, explain the very simple syntax (natural tuple syntax).
    Function call usage:

  - suggest `returns` or `output`, `output_args`, etc.

  - default unwrap for one argument, how to force wrap. Explain that trailing
    comma works (simplifies programatic generation of wishlist from a true 
    list). State explictely that repeating an argument is ok.

  - examine the variables that are required for early checks or 
    reduced computations.

  - automatic selection of the variables from `locals()` or
    manual selection.
